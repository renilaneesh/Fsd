                </h3><br>
                 <p>Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. Just like people, software robots can do things like understand what’s on a screen, complete the right keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions. But software robots can do it faster and more consistently than people, without the need to get up and stretch or take a coffee break.</p>

                <h3>Data Science</h3><br>
                <p>Data analytics refers to the process and practice of analyzing data to answer questions, extract insights, and identify trends. This is done using an array of tools, techniques, and frameworks that vary depending on the type of analysis being conducted.If you were to gather the world’s foremost business leaders and ask them to identify the biggest difference between doing business in the 20th century versus the 21st, a large percentage would likely say one word: data.
